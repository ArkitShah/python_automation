A simple project showing the example of how automation can be done using python.

Input file:

Output file:

I have used the openpyxl library in this project.


Here a simple example is shown which is used for printing the corrected values in another column.
The app.py has a function which takes 2 parameters - input file name and the output filename.


This app uses very less data as input, so here it is manually possible to correct the values but in real world applications there can be hundreds or even thousands of entries of data, so it becomes very difficult to perform the same operation there manually. So in situations like that we can use this type of python programs to do the operations just in matter of seconds. 
A graph is also generated in this excel sheet.

You can see the input and output files named as 'transactions.xlsx' and 'transactions2.xlsx' respectively.
